_**Update 2016-10-21**: In addition to Barcelona, I also did this workshop for javaBin Sørlandet, javaBin Trondheim, and javaBin Oslo (in cooperation with Semantic Meetup in Oslo) this autumn._

## What is it all about?


Ever heard of Zebra Puzzles? Those logical puzzles that are claimed to be invented by Albert Einstein as a little boy? Those that are based on simple logical facts and go something like this: 

> _“The Brit lives in the Red house. The Swede keeps dogs as pets. The Dane drinks tea... Who owns the zebra?"_

Some claim that only 2% of the population can solve it without any help.

However, with the help of semantic technologies we can solve it in (almost) no time. Of course you have to know RDF, OWL, Jena, reasoning, inference. The good news is that I will be showing you how it works in this session. 

Later, I will also post a link to the code for the rest of you to try all that at home.

## Contents

We will start with introducing the puzzle. Then we will continue by looking at the toolbox for solving it. We will build a semantic representation of the puzzle (basically, a graph!), programmatically add some inferred facts and reason and solve the puzzle.

Suddenly solving puzzles is a piece of cake for the other 98%.

## Workshop requirements

Now, over to what you will need:

* Your super computer
* Java 7, or later
* Git
* IDE of your choice
* [Maven 3.x][2]

Looking forward to running this workshop next week! See you there!
