## About me

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Oslo, and I have been working as a developer, lead programmer and architect for over 10 years. 

In addition to being passionate about agile development, web development, architecture and geographical information systems, I am also a guru of both Linux and Windows worlds. 

On my spare time I enjoy working out, as well as coding in Python and Java [but not simultaneously].

## Talks

I frequently speak at both national and international conferences, and events at various Norwegian universities.

You can find most of the events with my participation and my talks on my [Lanyrd profile][2].
