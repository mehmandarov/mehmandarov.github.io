## About me

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Oslo, and I have been working as a developer, lead programmer and architect for over 10 years. 

In addition to being passionate about agile development, web development, architecture and geographical information systems, I am also a guru of both Linux and Windows worlds.

On my spare time, I work with Java communities – leading the Norwegian Java User Group – [javaBin][6], and [JavaZone][1]; and cooperating with other Java User Groups around the world. 

Apart from that, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, working out, as well as coding in Python and Java [but not simultaneously].
