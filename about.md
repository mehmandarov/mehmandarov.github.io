![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Oslo, and I have been working as a developer, lead programmer and architect for over 10 years. 

In addition to being passionate about agile development, web development, architecture and geographical information systems, I am also a guru of both Linux and Windows worlds. 

On my spare time I enjoy working out, as well as coding in Python and Java [but not simultaneously].

Leader of the Norwegian Java User Group - javaBin, and a competency network coordinator for databases and information management at work.
