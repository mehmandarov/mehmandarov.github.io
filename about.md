## About me

I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Oslo. I have been working as a developer, lead programmer, and architect for over ten years. 

In addition to being passionate about agile development, web development, architecture and geographical information systems, I am also a guru of both Linux and Windows worlds.

On my spare time, I work with Java communities: leading and being otherwise involved in the world’s biggest community-driven Java conference – [JavaZone][1]; during the past years, being leader, second-in-command, and board member of the Norwegian Java User Group – [javaBin][6]; and cooperating with other Java User Groups around the world.

Apart from that, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, working out, as well as coding in Python and Java [but not simultaneously].

In addition to programming languages, I also enjoy natural languages. I fluently speak Norwegian, English, Russian, and Azerbaijani.
