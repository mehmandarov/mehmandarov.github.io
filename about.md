## About me

I hold a bachelor's and a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Oslo. I have been working as a developer, lead programmer, and architect for over fourteen years. 

In addition to being passionate about agile development, web development, architecture and geographical information systems, I am also a guru of both Linux and Windows worlds.

In my spare time, I work with developer communities both as an organiser, co-organiser, mentor, and as a program committee member for various national and international IT conferences and other events and meetups. I love cooperating and working closely with Google Developer Groups (GDGs), Java User Groups (JUGs) and other communities around the world.

Previously, I have been leading for three years and otherwise involved (for quite a bit longer) in the world’s biggest community-driven Java conference – JavaZone; and during the past years, being leader, second-in-command, and board member of the Norwegian Java User Group – javaBin. I was also one of the founders and organizers of the annual conference hackathon Arctic IoT Challenge in Oslo, Norway.

Apart from that, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, working out, as well as coding in Python and Java [but not simultaneously].

In addition to programming languages, I also enjoy natural languages. I fluently speak Norwegian, English, Russian, and Azerbaijani.
